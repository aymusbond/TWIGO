# TWIGO

TWIGO gives you the power to control your bike with fingerprint sensors and smart pins that will be managed by the TWIGO app.

The module will have GPS/GSM trackers that will save your parking position and as soon as your bike moves out of the 10 m radius from your parking spot without switching it on the bike immediately sends you a notification, lock-downs your complete bike and starts a sharp siren to attract pedistrian attention. It will also keep tracking your bike's position.

The app also encorporates a very cool feature of showing you all the nearby available pay parking slots even at facades of other people's homes! Imagine you can also rent your useless house facade to earn some money by letting other park their bikes.

The last but not the least thing we did is connecting the module to important parts of the bike, measuring and sharing with you information such as bike usage, mileage, performance, etc. It will also store all you verified digital bike certificates and driving license.

Imagine the power of TWIGO!!!
